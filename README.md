Project was to replicate Google's homepage (without the functionality). Skills learned/practiced: creating/opening/using an html file, setting up another GitHub repo from terminal, html/css for a basic document with header, footer, buttons, image, search form. Big struggles: arranging elements on the page/CSS layout.  Getting the elements onto the page in the correct places felt impossible. Spent hours on it and its still not perfect. Going to move on and hopefully as I progress with CSS I can come back and correct it. Things that were easy: Matching design ex. replicating logo, search bar, colors, font etc. was all very easy and intuitive.
